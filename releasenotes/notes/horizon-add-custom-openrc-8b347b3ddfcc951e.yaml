    If an openrc.sh.template file is placed in Horizon's service configuration
    directory, it will be used to template the OpenRC files generated by
    Horizon. This can be useful for operators who wish to use nonstandard
    login methods other than v3password, the default, or else adjust the
    defaults generated by Horizon for the user.

    See documentation for `OPENRC_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/configuration/settings.html#openrc-custom-template>`_
    in Horizon for more information on how this works.
